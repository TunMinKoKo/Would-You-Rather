# Would You Rather Project

## This app was built as a project for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. 

## The primary purpose for developing Would You Rather was to gain exposure to React & Redux, thus core functionality such as user authentication and the project backend is mocked. As a result you will notice that data does not persist when the browser is refreshed
